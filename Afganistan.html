    <p>After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan.The group completed their shockingly rapid advance across the country by capturing Kabul on 15 August.
        It came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001.
        The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.Taliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West.
        But questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms.</p>

    <h3>Hot Matter</h3>
    <p>Taliban in Afghanistan | Why Taliban takeover of Afghanistan matters to the world Over the past decades, the fate of Afghanistan has been inevitably intertwined with the Taliban, which has regained control 20 years after it was chased out of its strongholds by 9/11-hit America. But, is a Taliban regime only a matter of concern for the Afghans? Let’s understand why Taliban takeover of Afghanistan matters to the world, and India.</p>
    <p>Over the past decades, the fate of Afghanistan has been inevitably intertwined with the Taliban, the brutish group of fundamentalists back in control 20 years after it was chased out of its strongholds by 9/11-hit America. As the Taliban rose, then fell and was resurrected, the war-torn nation swung between gloom and hope and despair again. But, is a Taliban regime only a matter of concern for the Afghans? Let’s understand why Taliban takeover of Afghanistan matters to the world, and India</p>
   <p>Taliban regime, a human rights crisis | There is ample evidence that the Taliban of today are not much different from the Taliban of 20 years ago. Already, educational institutes for women and girls have been shut, smartphones and televisions have been banned, women are being forced to marry Taliban fighters and the lives of those who raised their voice against the Taliban are at risk</p>
 <p>Taliban regime, Chinese foothold in the region | In the past when the Taliban were in power, Afghanistan was isolated from the rest of the world, save for Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But now, top Taliban leaders have been couting Iran, Russia and China. China has reportedly promised big investments in energy and infrastructure projects, and is preparing to formally recognize the Taliban. China is seen as a source of international legitimacy for the group, a potential economic supporter and a means of influence over Pakistan.</p>

    <h3>What after US exit from Afghanistan?</h3>     
    <p>Biden’s announcement has removed all incentives for the Taliban to agree for a dialogue with the Afghan government. In a statement on Thursday, the Taliban indicated as much: “The Islamic Emirate will under no circumstance ever relent on complete independence and establishment of a pure Islamic system, and remain committed to a peaceful solution to the Afghan problem following the complete and certain end of occupation.The proposal by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in March is now almost certainly dead in the water.<br><br> It included a 90-day ceasefire; talks under the auspices of the UN for a consensus plan for Afghanistan among the US, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and India; and a meeting in Turkey between the Taliban and Afghan government towards an “inclusive” interim government, an agreement on the foundational principles of the future political order and for a permanent ceasefire.
        <br><br>Turkey has scheduled the talks for April 24, and the Biden Administration has said it remains committed to finding a political solution. But the Taliban are now in a different zone.        
        The Taliban declared in the statement that the “American officials have understood the Afghan situation” but as the withdrawal had been put off “by several months” to September, rather than stick to the Doha Agreement (signed between the Trump Administration’s special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban last March) date of May 1, America had violated the agreement.<br><br> This had “opened the way” for the Taliban to take “counter-measures”, and the American side “will be held responsible for all future consequences, and not the Islamic Emirate”.</p>
